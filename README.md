📜 Project: Document Storage & Verification with OCR & AI
🚀 A secure and intelligent document storage, classification, and verification system using OCR, AI-based classification, and blockchain-inspired hash verification.



📌 Problem Statement
In organizations, students, and legal document handling, verifying and categorizing important documents (e.g., question papers, notices, certificates) is a major challenge:
- No standard structure for storing and organizing files.
- Duplicate file uploads without any check.
- Manual classification of documents is time-consuming.
- Difficult verification of document authenticity.
- No automated text extraction from PDFs/images.



💡 Our Solution
We provide an AI-driven secure document management system that:

✅ Uses OCR (Tesseract.js) to extract text from scanned documents.  
✅ Uses AI-based classification to organize files into categories.  
✅ Hashes every file (SHA-256) to prevent duplicate uploads.  
✅ Allows users to verify authenticity using a document hash.  
✅ Provides a structured storage system for efficient retrieval.

📖 Setup Guide

1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/anshulsenpai/transform-docs-api.git
cd document-verification-system

2️⃣ Install Dependencies
npm install

3️⃣ Create a `.env` File
PORT=5050
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/document_db
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
UPLOAD_DIR=uploads

4️⃣ Start the Server
npm start

Your API will be running at `http://localhost:5050` 🚀

🛠 API Endpoints
🔐 Authentication
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|-|--|-|
| `/api/auth/register` | `POST` | Register a new user |
| `/api/auth/login` | `POST` | Login and get JWT token |

📂 Document Handling
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|-|--|-|
| `/api/documents/upload` | `POST` | Upload document (PDF, Image) |
| `/api/documents/verify` | `POST` | Verify document authenticity |

🔍 How It Works

1️⃣ User logs in and receives a JWT token.  
2️⃣ Uploads a document (PDF/Image) using `/api/documents/upload`.  
3️⃣ The system:
   - ✅ Extracts text (OCR)
   - ✅ Classifies document into a structured format
   - ✅ Stores metadata and file securely
4️⃣ User can verify the authenticity of a document using `/api/documents/verify`.
